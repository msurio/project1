# Project 1
## Elevator Pitch
Hi, our group created an application that lets users plan their day during the quarantine. The application gives users four options, “Do Nothing”, “Do Something”, “Tell Me a Joke”, or “Go Outside”. Users can choose an option based on their mood. In addition, we provided the current weather so users can plan out their day based on the weather conditions.
## Concept
### Description
The Quarantine Day Planner is used to help those stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We used several APIs to provide the user with ideas for activities based on how they are feeling that day.
Motivation for development?
Everyone can relate to this project
People needed ideas to keep themselves occupied while stuck at home, or with limited options of what to do during quarantine.
User story
As a person stuck in quarantine.
We all need something to occupy our time.
So that we can keep busy and not go crazy.
## Process
### Technologies used:
YouTube API
NPS (National Park Service) API
TMDb API
### Breakdown of tasks and roles:
Creating a low fidelity wireframe
CSS Framework & Skeleton HTML5 Code
Finding API’s and how to use them
Work on each button to split the workload
### Challenges:
Pushing & Pulling from GitHub
Trying to get certain API’s to work and call them in.
## Successes
We did what we could on our own and then worked as a group to complete the scripts.
NPS looked like it wasn’t working, but the API just has a long server side load time.
We couldn’t get the TMDb to console log or show any of the responses, but Josh H. found a YouTube video to use the API.
